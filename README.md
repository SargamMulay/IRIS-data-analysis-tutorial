The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) is a NASA satellite designed for solar observation.

There are two instruments onboard IRIS satellite - Slit Jaw Imager (SJI) and Spectrograph (SG).

• The IRIS was launched in July 2013 to study the chromosphere and transition region \
• Provides simultaneous images and spectra \
• Far-UV: 1331.56 - 1358.40 & 1390.00 - 1406.79 Å \
• Near-UV: 2782.56 - 2833.89 Å \
• Temporal resolution: 2 sec \
• Spatial resolution: 1 pixel = 0.33" = 241.76 km \
• Spectral resolution: 26 mÅ (FUV), 53 mÅ (NUV) \
• Temperature: between 5000 K to 10 MK \
• Spectrograph slit movement: Solar East to West (in the same direction as the solar rotation) \
• Observation modes for spectrograph: raster and sit-and-stare mode
